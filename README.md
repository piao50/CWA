CWA - Chemical Warfare Agents
===

# Chemical Agents (CA)
Chemical Agents:
  Chemical agents are chemical substances that are intended for use in warfare or terrorist activities to kill, seriously injure, or seriously incapacitate people through their physiological effects.
  The most common CAs are the nerve agents, GA (tabun), GB (sarin), GD (soman), GF (cyclosarin), and VX; and the blister agents, H and HD (sulfur mustard), HN (nitrogen mustard), and the arsenical vesicant L (lewisite).

* GA: A low volatility persistent CA that is taken up through skin contact and inhalation as a gas or an aerosol.
* GB: A volatile nonpersistent CA that is mainly taken up through inhalation as a gas or aerosol.
* GD: A moderately volatile CA that can be taken up by skin contact or through inhalation as a gas or aerosol.
* GF: A low volatility persistent CA that is taken up through skin contact and inhalation of the substance as a gas or aerosol.
* VX: A low volatility persistent CA that can remain on material, equipment, and terrain for long periods. Uptake is mainly through the skin but also through inhalation of the substance as a gas or aerosol.

Route of Entry:
  Nerve agents, either as a gas, aerosol, or liquid, enter the body through inhalation or through the skin.

# CHEMICAL DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES
Point Detection Technologies:
* Ionization/Ion Mobility Spectrometry. A detector using ionization/ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) technology is typically a stand-alone
detector that samples the environment using an air pump.Contaminants in the sampled air areionized by a radioactive source, and the resultant ions traverse the drift tube through an electric field toward an ion detector. The flight time, or the time it takes the ions to traverse the distance, is proportional to the size and shape of the ionized chemical species and is used for identification of the species. Analysis time ranges from several seconds to a few minutes.
* Flame Photometry. Flame photometry is based on burning ambient air with hydrogen gas.
* Infrared Spectroscopy. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is the measurement of the wavelength and intensity of the absorption of mid-infrared light by a sample.
* Electrochemistry. Electrochemical detectors monitor the resistance of a thin film that changes as the film absorbs chemicals from the air or monitors a change in the electric potential of an electrode when chemicals in solution or in air are absorbed.
* Colorimetric. Colorimetric chemistry is a wet chemistry technique formulated to indicate the presence of a CA by a chemical reaction that causes a color change when agents come in contact with certain solutions or substrates.
* Surface Acoustic Wave. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) detectors consist of piezoelectric crystals coated with a film designed to absorb CAs from the air.
* Photoionization Detection. Photoionization detection (PID) works by exposing a gas stream to an ultraviolet light of a wavelength with enough energy to ionize an agent molecule.
* Thermal and Electrical Conductivity. Thermal and electrical conductivity detectors use metal oxide thermal semiconductors that measure the change in heat conductivity that occurs as a result of gas adsorption on the metal oxide surface.
* Flame Ionization. A flame ionization detector (FID) is a general-purpose detector used to determine the presence of volatile carbon-based compounds that are incinerated in a hydrogen-oxygen or hydrogen-air flame.
* Polymer Composite Detection Materials. Polymer composite detection materials consist of individual thin-film carbon-black/polymer composite chemi-resistors configured into an array.
